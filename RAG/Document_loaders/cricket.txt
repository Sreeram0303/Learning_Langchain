"The Symphony of Willow and Leather"
Beneath the blaze of golden skies,
Where fields stretch wide and hope still flies,
The game begins, a noble start—
Of cricket, song within the heart.

With crease drawn bold and pitch well-laid,
In whites the warriors stand arrayed,
The silence hums, the crowd takes breath,
Awaiting thunder, pace, and depth.

The bowler runs with rhythmic grace,
A tempest etched upon his face,
His fingers curl, the seam is spun—
The battle’s waged before it’s won.

The batter waits, a statue still,
With iron nerves and sharpened skill,
A crack!—the ball takes flight with might,
A six! It sails into the night.

The slip cordon crouches, nerves on edge,
Like hunters waiting near the hedge.
Each edge a chance, a gasp, a cheer,
For one faint nick, all fortunes veer.

The spinner twirls a web so sly,
A sorcerer with a knowing eye,
The ball may dip, may drift, may turn—
A game of wits at every turn.

The outfield gleams with emerald pride,
Where dives and throws in arcs reside.
A fielder chases like the wind,
A boundary lost, a run now pinned.

The captain thinks, a chessboard mind,
Adjusts the field, rechecks the bind.
A single change, a genius spark,
Can shift the game from light to dark.

The crowd erupts, then holds its breath,
In cricket, drama lives in death.
Each dot a dagger, each run gold,
Each over's tale forever told.

Tea’s taken when the sun leans low,
And tales are shared of ebb and flow.
The scoreboard paints a work of art,
Of triumph, loss, and beating heart.

And when the shadows start to grow,
The final overs steal the show.
A chase is set, the pressure tight,
Heroes are born beneath the light.

The stumps may fly, the bat may raise,
The crowd may chant, the critics praise.
But deep beneath the glitz and cheer,
Lives love for cricket—crystal clear.

From village greens to floodlit domes,
Across all lands and countless homes,
This game unites with silent thread,
The living, dreaming, and the dead.

So here’s to cricket—grace and might,
A sport, a war, a soul’s delight.
A tale of courage, skill, and song—
May cricket’s spirit live ever long.
